This app was made as a solo project as part of the intermediate Scrimba React course. The app is a single-player game of Tenzies: see the rules here: https://ilovetenzi.com/rules/

The goals of the app were to:

(1) do a solo project using React concepts like passing and destructuring props, children, reusable components, (local and unified) state management, useEffect hooks, conditional rendering, event listeners, and more.
(2) practic implementing SCSS based on Figma designs 
(3) get familiar with continous deployment on Netlify through Github.
